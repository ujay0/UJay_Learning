# The interquartile range of an array is the difference between 
# its first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles (i.e., Q3 - Q1).

# Given an array, values, of  integers and an array, freqs, representing the 
# respective frequencies of values's elements, construct a data set, S, 
# where each value[i] occurs at frequency freqs[i]. Then calculate and 
# print S's interquartile range, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal 
# place (i.e., 12.3 format).

# Tip: Be careful to not use integer division when averaging the 
# middle two elements for a data set with an even number of elements,
#  and be sure to not include the median in your upper and lower 
# data sets.
